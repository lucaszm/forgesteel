Change is the engine of existence. Permanence begets stagnation. When the past refuses to relinquish control, a path must be cleared for the future.

For the true gift of life is death, and gifts are meant to be given.

Only one destined for death can contain the power of the Mortal Coil. A mortal creature who carries this artifact serves as its host, gaining an additional action on each of their turns, aging at ten times the normal rate, and becoming unable to ever regain Stamina. A host with no natural maximum lifespan permanently reduces their maximum Stamina by 10 each year.

When the Mortal Coil is left unattended or is in the possession of a creature who is not mortal, it activates and can't be deactivated until a mortal creature becomes its host once more. While active, the artifact extends a penumbra of influence for 10 miles in every direction. Every creature in the penumbra is subject to the following effects.`,
